Reading how Linux Drivers and Device tree work in:
https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/docs/lesson03/linux/interrupt_controllers.md

Got this example of Interrupts to work!!! (AARCH64)
/s-matyukevich-AAR64/raspberry-pi-os/exercises/lesson03/1/rs/src

Change Kernel7.img to kernal8.img.  Copy this file and config.txt to the pi boot sd card.

This example will write a string to the UART every second.  The timer interrupt will trigger writing to the UART.  The interrupt will reset the timer back to zero.
