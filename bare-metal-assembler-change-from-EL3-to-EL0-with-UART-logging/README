In this example we are going to change the EL (exception level) 
of a process from EL3 to EL0

This example builds off of example:
bare-metal-assembler-determine-coreID-and-EL


Findings

- you can only change from level En to En-1  (example EL3 to El2)
- MRS CurrentEL does not work in EL0, it throws an exception
