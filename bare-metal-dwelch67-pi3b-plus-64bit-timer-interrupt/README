Interrupt based, you know how I feel about interrupts (only if
necessary which a blinker is not but for demonstration purposes).

Booting without a config.txt means we land in EL2 as of this writing,
but EL1 is intended for the OS level and EL0 for the application so
we go down to EL1 to make life easier.

The GICC is basically disabled by pulling a GICCDISABLE line high
on the edge of the core, this is good makes the IRQ/FIQ outside
the core and feeding the core just like prior raspi chips.

Messing with the uart like this in the irq is very dangerous, and should
not be done I only do it because I know in this code the foreground
and irq will never collide with respect to the uart.  (the interrupt
wont interrupt a uart_send()).

unanswered questions

How do you get out of a wfi/wfe?
Shouldnt the interrupt do that?
There is a control register apparently, more reading...
